### License
We chose the [MIT license](https://licenses.nuget.org/MIT) for our application, with the major reason being it's open-source nature towards programming-collaboration. Furthermore all the dependencies which we use in our application are also under the MIT license except one, which encourages the collaborative nature of the programming community. A list of all our dependencies and their licenses can be found [here](../License.md). One of our packages is under the [Apache-license](https://licenses.nuget.org/Apache-2.0), which is fine since both are permissive licenses meaning they are able to be used together. This is also stated in our license file.
