# AI Section

## AI Help

In this section we will go over the AI help that has been through out the process of creating the project. This will be about what AI help has been used and to what extend.

### ChatGBT

ChatGBT is one of the AI's that we have used through out the project for smaller questions. Theses questions range from C# code, refactoring of code, setup of docker or .NET projects. With the help from the AI we can ask questions and get quick response that can help us in the right direction. There are somethings to consider when using ChatGBT the main thing will being the validity of the response since we can't guarantee that it's right.

### Github CoPilot

Github CoPilot has been used through out the project to help with speeding up the process of writing code. It gives suggestions to code that you were writing either way with autocompleting a few lines. It can also sometimes help with debugging. It has also help with the creation of unit tests.
<!-- ChatGBT and/or CoPilot
ChatGBT was used for small questions, or just the simple things as refactoring through the code
 
CoPilot made it a lot easier to make the unit tests after the first few where created, it made this particular task go faster.
It was helpful in autocompleting a few lines, and sometimes to help debug using the coPilot chat. -->
