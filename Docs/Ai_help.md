# AI Section

## AI Help

In this section we will go over the AI help that has been through out the process of creating the project.

### ChatGPT

ChatGPT is one of the AI's that we have used through out the project for smaller questions. Theses questions range from C# related code, refactoring of code, setup of docker or .NET console commands. With the help from the AI we can ask questions and get quick response that can help us in the right direction. There are somethings to consider when using ChatGPT the main thing will be the validity of the response since we can't guarantee that it's right.

### Github CoPilot

Github CoPilot has been used through out the project to help with speeding up the process of writing code. This range from repetitive code to unit tests. This is where CoPilot shines with helping auto completion. With the recommendation that you get from CoPilot may not work since the AI can't know the full extend of the program.

<!-- ChatGBT and/or CoPilot
ChatGBT was used for small questions, or just the simple things as refactoring through the code
 
CoPilot made it a lot easier to make the unit tests after the first few where created, it made this particular task go faster.
It was helpful in autocompleting a few lines, and sometimes to help debug using the coPilot chat. -->
