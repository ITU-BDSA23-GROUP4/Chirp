Illustrate typical scenarios of a user journey through your Chirp! application. That is, start illustrating the first page that is presented to a non-authorized user, illustrate what a non-authorized user can do with your Chirp! application, and finally illustrate what a user can do after authentication. 

Make sure that the illustrations are in line with the actual behavior of your application.
