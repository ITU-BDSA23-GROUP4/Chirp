There was a lot of reference issue, to get a hold on the database, which is a different project. <br />

Jobs of the day:
1. Merge all done branches (singleton and EndToEnd) - no issues appeared
2. Refactoring cheeps to its own file
3. Life compiler fix (compiler dont work)
4. Finish unit and integration test
5. Merge everything into main

### Issues resolves
[Issue #12](/../../issues/12), [Issue #10](/../../issues/10), [Issue #9](/../../issues/9), [Issue #7](/../../issues/7), [Issue #8](/../../issues/8) <br />
(1) - There were no issues when merging singleton and EndToEnd into development. When working with tests, we had issues when getting a hold of the database, in the endToEnd test, we struggles to get the chirp.dll file and the dotnet file, so that it would be used globally, and not only depend on the single computer.  <br />
(2) - When merging the refactored cheeps branch into the other, the layout of the dates where changes, giving it a few complications. We solves this by setting a default culture to the date and time, making it be in the same format across devices. <br />
(3) -  <br />
(4) -  <br />
(5) -  <br />
