## User story
Write it from the user perspective (end-user, admin) if it's a feature.
Write it from the developers (or equal) perspective, if it's a change to the code architechture or 
similar.

## Precise description of what to do and evt. time estimate

## Acceptance criteria (testeable)

## Notes:
The issues should be small enough to resolve in less than a day.
Divide if necessary.
Be sure to cover the INVEST acronym:
- Independent: The User Story stands for itself and is independent of other stories.
- Negotiable: The content is negotiable and is gradually described in more detail until it can be implemented.
- Valuable: It is valuable and offers the user or customer an added value or benefit.
- Estimable: The effort to realise it must be estimable by the developers.
- Small: It is so small that it can be realised within one iteration or sprint.
- Testable: It has acceptance criteria and can be tested.
